1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,440
Darling, why give blood

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,514
when you could sell...

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,370
Plasma?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,000
[laughing]

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
My name is Plasma, and I'm a 65 year old

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,650
woman inhabiting this gorgeous 24 year old's body.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,080
My style is very 1950's Hollywood Glamour.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,160
Ooooh, she's elegant.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,670
Ooooooh

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,170
she's

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,030
royal.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,040
[giggling]

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,080
I was raised listening to Julie Andrews,

14
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,250
Judy Garland, Barbera Streisand, all these musical theater giants.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,970
And when I was very young, I realized that I wanted to be a performer.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,200
And then when I learned that I could make

17
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,800
money being a performer,

18
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,240
bitch,

19
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,386
the game changed.

20
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,390
[everybody giggling]

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,810
[Plasma]: Diva, what's your name? [Hershii]: Hershii LaQuor-Jete.

22
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,997
[Plasma]: Girl...

23
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,015
You're going to have to say that one more time, a little bit slower.

24
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,010
I'm a great host.

25
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm a great singer. I'm a comedian.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,600
I love to connect with anyone and everyone in the room.

27
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,570
[Hershii]: Where were you from? [Plasma]: Well, I was born in Texas,

28
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,120
and then we moved to New York darling, New York!

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,680
What about you?

30
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,440
[Hershii]: She's a New York queen.

31
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,280
St Louis, Missouri, Atlanta, Los Angeles. I'm hometown for you.

32
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
[Plasma]: Okay! She got three names.

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
She got three homes! How about that?

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,560
[Hershii]: Period! This feels so surreal.

35
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
[Plasma]: Yeah.
I hate to say it, and it never has a good

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,730
connotation, but it's smaller than I expected.

37
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
[Hershii]: I expected it to be wider. [Plasma]: Wider?

38
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,240
[Hershii]: Yeah.

39
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:18,940
[Plasma]: I thought you said whiter, and I was like..

40
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,410
Well.

41
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,871
[both audibly laughing]

42
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,030
[lively and vibrant Mexican music playing]

43
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:29,914
Viva Mexico...

44
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:30,714
Ca..

45
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,257
brones!

46
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:33,423
Mwah!

47
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:37,557
[Geneva]: Mi nombre es Geneva Carr, or as everybody knows me, Geneva Broom Broom Carr.

48
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,840
Geneva Carr's drag style is very dramatic.

49
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,570
Escándalo, brillo, fantasía, and of course, a lot of Mexican spice.

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,160
[Geneva]: How are you, Monster? Hello!

51
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,410
[Plasma]: Oh, sorry, I hit you with the hat. I'm Plasma.

52
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,240
[Geneva]: Purpose. We just started, you're trying to kill me!

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,050
[Geneva]: She's a dancing queen. She's a diva.

54
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,340
This Mexican puts the 

55
00:01:59,414 --> 00:01:59,814
ASS

56
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,343
in

57
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:00,943
Tex-ASS,

58
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:02,014
and soon all over the world..

59
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:03,400
boom
